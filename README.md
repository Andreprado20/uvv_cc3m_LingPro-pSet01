## Luhn Algorithm

This repository contains the files with the solution of the problem Set of the Week 1 of the CS50 course, assigned to the CC3M class by the teacher of the discipline **Concepts of Programming Languages**, [Mr. Abrantes Araujo Silva Filho](https://github.com/abrantesasf).

It has two files, each one with a working solution of the problem (one of them in C language and the other one in Python language).

The problem Set challenges you to implement in a programming language the Luhn Algorithm, which is a math algorithm used to verify if a given credit card number is valid. You can check out the description of the Problem Set and see more about how the Luhn algorithm works [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/credit/) on the Harvard CS50 course page.
